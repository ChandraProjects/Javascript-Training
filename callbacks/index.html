                        <strong>Callbacks?</strong>
                        <p>A callback is a function that will be executed when an asynchronous operation has been
                            completed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A callback is passed as an argument to an asynchronous operation. Normally, this is passed
                            as the last argument of the
                            function. Doing this it’s a good practice, so keep that in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>The callback structure seems like this:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function sayHello() {
                                    console.log('Hello everyone');
                                }
                                
                                setTimeout(sayHello(), 3000)
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            What we did in the above example was, first to define a function that prints a message to
                            the console. After that, we
                            use a timer called setTimeout (this timer is a native Javascript function). This timer is an
                            asynchronous operation that
                            executes the callback after a certain time. In this example, after 3000ms (3 seconds) will
                            be executed the sayHello
                            function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are other real-world examples of asynchronous actions, e.g. loading scripts and
                            modules.
                            <br>
                            Take a look at the function loadScript(src), that loads a script with the given src:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function loadScript(src) {
                                    // creates a script tag and append it to the page
                                    // this causes the script with given src to start loading and run when complete
                                    let script = document.createElement('script');
                                    script.src = src;
                                    document.head.append(script);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            It appends to the document the new, dynamically created, tag
                            with given src.The browser automatically starts loading it and executes when complete.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // load and execute the script at the given path
                                loadScript('/my/script.js');
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>The script is executed “asynchronously”, as it starts loading now, but runs later, when the
                            function has already
                            finished.
                        </p>
                        <p>If there’s any code below loadScript(…), it doesn’t wait until the script loading finishes.
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('/my/script.js');
                                // the code below loadScript
                                // doesn't wait for the script loading to finish
                                // ...
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Let’s say we need to use the new script as soon as it loads. It declares new functions, and
                            we want to run them.
                            <br>
                            But if we do that immediately after the loadScript(…) call, that wouldn’t work:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('/my/script.js'); // the script has "function newFunction() {…}"
                                
                                newFunction(); // no such function!
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Naturally, the browser probably didn’t have time to load the script. As of now, the
                            loadScript function doesn’t provide
                            a way to track the load completion. The script loads and eventually runs, that’s all. But
                            we’d like to know when it
                            happens, to use new functions and variables from that script.
                        </p>

                        <p>Let’s add a callback function as a second argument to loadScript that should execute when the
                            script loads:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function loadScript(src, callback) {
                                    let script = document.createElement('script');
                                    script.src = src;
                                    
                                    script.onload = () => callback(script);
                                    
                                    document.head.append(script);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now if we want to call new functions from the script, we should write that in the callback:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('/my/script.js', function() {
                                    // the callback runs after the script is loaded
                                    newFunction(); // so now it works
                                    ...
                                });
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>That’s the idea: the second argument is a function (usually anonymous) that runs when the
                            action is completed.

                            Here’s a runnable example with a real script:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function loadScript(src, callback) {
                                    let script = document.createElement('script');
                                    script.src = src;
                                    script.onload = () => callback(script);
                                    document.head.append(script);
                                }
                                
                                loadScript('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/3.2.0/lodash.js', script => {
                                    alert(`Cool, the script ${script.src} is loaded`);
                                    alert( _ ); // function declared in the loaded script
                                });
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>That’s called a “callback-based” style of asynchronous programming. A function that does
                            something asynchronously should
                            provide a callback argument where we put the function to run after it’s complete.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here we did it in loadScript, but of course it’s a general approach.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Callback in callback</strong>

                        <p>How can we load two scripts sequentially: the first one, and then the second one after it?

                            The natural solution would be to put the second loadScript call inside the callback, like
                            this:</p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('/my/script.js', function(script) {
                                
                                    alert(`Cool, the ${script.src} is loaded, let's load one more`);
                                    
                                    loadScript('/my/script2.js', function(script) {
                                        alert(`Cool, the second script is loaded`);
                                    });
                                
                                });
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>After the outer loadScript is complete, the callback initiates the inner one.

                            What if we want one more script…?</p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('/my/script.js', function(script) {

                                    loadScript('/my/script2.js', function(script) {

                                    loadScript('/my/script3.js', function(script) {
                                        // ...continue after all scripts are loaded
                                    });
                                    })
                                });
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>So, every new action is inside a callback. That’s fine for few actions, but not good for
                            many, so we’ll see other
                            variants soon.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Handling errors</strong>

                        <p>In the above examples we didn’t consider errors. What if the script loading fails? Our
                            callback should be able to react
                            on that.

                            Here’s an improved version of loadScript that tracks loading errors:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function loadScript(src, callback) {
                                    let script = document.createElement('script');
                                    script.src = src;
                                    
                                    script.onload = () => callback(null, script);
                                    script.onerror = () => callback(new Error(`Script load error for ${src}`));
                                
                                    document.head.append(script);
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>It calls callback(null, script) for successful load and callback(error) otherwise.
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('/my/script.js', function(error, script) {
                                    if (error) {
                                        // handle error
                                    } else {
                                        // script loaded successfully
                                    }
                                });
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Once again, the recipe that we used for loadScript is actually quite common. It’s called the
                            “error-first callback”
                            style.
                        </p>
                        <p>The convention is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first argument of the callback is reserved for an error if it occurs. Then
                                callback(err) is called.</li>
                            <li>The second argument (and the next ones if needed) are for the successful result. Then
                                callback(null, result1, result2…)
                                is called.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So the single callback function is used both for reporting errors and passing back results.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Pyramid of Doom</strong>
                        <p>
                            From the first look, it’s a viable way of asynchronous coding. And indeed it is. For one or
                            maybe two nested calls it
                            looks fine.

                            But for multiple asynchronous actions that follow one after another we’ll have code like
                            this:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('1.js', function(error, script) {
                                
                                    if (error) {
                                        handleError(error);
                                    } else {
                                    // ...
                                    loadScript('2.js', function(error, script) {
                                        if (error) {
                                             handleError(error);
                                        } else {
                                    // ...

                                        loadScript('3.js', function(error, script) {
                                            if (error) {
                                                handleError(error);
                                            } else {
                                        // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)
                                            }
                                        });
                                        }
                                    })
                                    }
                                });
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>In the code above:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>We load 1.js, then if there’s no error.</li>
                            <li>We load 2.js, then if there’s no error.</li>
                            <li>We load 3.js, then if there’s no error – do something else (*).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As calls become more nested, the code becomes deeper and increasingly more difficult to
                            manage, especially if we have
                            real code instead of ... that may include more loops, conditional statements and so on.

                            That’s sometimes called “callback hell” or “pyramid of doom.”</p>

                        <p>The “pyramid” of nested calls grows to the right with every asynchronous action. Soon it
                            spirals out of control.

                            So this way of coding isn’t very good.

                            We can try to alleviate the problem by making every action a standalone function, like this:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                loadScript('1.js', step1);
                                
                                function step1(error, script) {
                                    if (error) {
                                        handleError(error);
                                    } else {
                                    // ...
                                        loadScript('2.js', step2);
                                    }
                                }
                                
                                function step2(error, script) {
                                    if (error) {
                                        handleError(error);
                                    } else {
                                        // ...
                                        loadScript('3.js', step3);
                                    }
                                }
                                
                                function step3(error, script) {
                                    if (error) {
                                        handleError(error);
                                    } else {
                                        // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)
                                    }
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>See? It does the same, and there’s no deep nesting now because we made every action a
                            separate top-level function.
                        </p>
                        <p>It works, but the code looks like a torn apart spreadsheet. It’s difficult to read, and you
                            probably noticed that one
                            needs to eye-jump between pieces while reading it. That’s inconvenient, especially if the
                            reader is not familiar with
                            the code and doesn’t know where to eye-jump.</p>

                        <p>Also, the functions named step* are all of single use, they are created only to avoid the
                            “pyramid of doom.” No one is
                            going to reuse them outside of the action chain. So there’s a bit of namespace cluttering
                            here.
                            <br>
                            We’d like to have something better.
                            <br>
                            Luckily, there are other ways to avoid such pyramids. One of the best ways is to use
                            “promises”.</p>
