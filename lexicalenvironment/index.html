                        <strong>Lexical Scoping</strong>
                        <p>Before we can discuss closures, we should have a basic understanding of the scope and lexical
                            scope. JavaScript has
                            lexical scoping with function scope, which means each function creates a new scope.</p>
                        <strong>What is function scope?</strong>
                        <p>Basically, in JavaScript, there is Global Scope and Local Scope.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Global Scope:</b> There is only one Global Scope in a Javascript Document i.e. area
                            outside all
                            the functions and how you
                            can identify a global scope is that the variable defined in the global scope can be accessed
                            anywhere in the code.

                            <b>Local Scope:</b> Variables declared inside functions are local to the function and is
                            bound to
                            the corresponding local
                            scope. Those variables cannot be accessed outside the functions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's see an example:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // global scope
                                let iHaveGlobalScope=`I can be accessed from anywhere in this document`

                                function localScope(){
                                    console.log(iHaveGlobalScope)

                                    // lcoal scope1
                                    let iHaveLocalScope=`I am bound to the local scope of function localScope`
                                }


                                console.log(localScope())
                                //I can be accessed from anywhere in this document

                                console.log(iHaveLocalScope)
                                //ReferenceError: iHaveLocalScope is not defined
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>The variable iHaveGlobalScope is declared in the global scope and therefore can be accessed
                            even from within the
                            function localScope(), but when I try to console log the variable iHaveLocalScope outside
                            the function or outside the
                            local scope, it throws a Reference Error at runtime.

                            The local scope can be further divided into function scope and block scope. The concept of
                            block scope was introduced in
                            ES6 together with the new ways to declare variables — const and let.</p>
                        <strong>Function Scope and Block Scope</strong>
                        <p>Whenever you declare a variable inside a function, the variable is bound within the function
                            and you can’t access it
                            outside the function. var is the keyword to define a variable for function-scope
                            accessibility.</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function functionScope(){
                                    var iHaveFunctionScope=`something something mj`
                                    console.log(iHaveFunctionScope)
                                }
                                functionScope()
                                //something something mj
                                
                                console.log(iHaveFunctionScope);
                                //Reference Error
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now, you might ask, if it gives an error even if you use let or const, why is only var
                            associated with function scope?
                            The thing is, let and const are used to define block scope, and before ES6, JavaScript
                            didn't have block scope or let
                            and const.</p>
                        <p><b>A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Simply put
                                , whenever you see {curly
                                brackets}, it is a block.</b></p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function scope(){
                                    if(true){
                                        var scope1 =`I have function Scope`
                                        let scope2 = `I have block scope`
                                        const scope3 =`I also have block scope`
                                    }
                                    console.log(scope1)
                                    console.log(scope2)
                                    console.log(scope3)
                                }
                                scope()
                                
                                //I have function Scope
                                
                                //ReferenceError: scope2 is not defined
                                
                                //ReferenceError: scope3 is not defined
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now you might expect that none of the log commands should work but as you can see that is not
                            the case with var,
                            variables defined with var inside if, switch conditions or for and while loops can be
                            accessed globally and are part of
                            global scope and hence it is better practice to use let and const with them.</p>
                        <strong>Lexical Scope
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            Finally, we have reached the true purpose of this post. Well, I could have skipped the long
                            discussion of scope but
                            personally, I don’t think you can understand lexical scope without knowing the key
                            components revolving around it.
                            <br>
                            Again, a point to remember: Javascript has lexical scoping with functions scope.
                            <br>
                            In simple words, it means the children scope has access to the variables defined in the
                            parent scope. For instance, If I
                            were to define a function and declare a variable inside it and inside the very same
                            function, define another function,
                            then I should be able to use that variable inside the inner function because of lexical
                            scoping. Let's see an example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function outerFunction() {
                                    var variable1 = 'ney vatsa'
                                    const variable2 = 'shashank jha'
                                    let variable3 = 'huda'

                                    function innerFunction() {
                                        console.log(variable1)
                                        console.log(variable2)
                                        console.log(variable3)
                                    }
                                    innerFunction()
                                }

                                outerFunction()
                                // ney vatsa
                                //shashank jha
                                //huda
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            It can be seen from the example, the variables declared in outerFunction() are accessed by
                            innerfunction(), this is
                            lexical scoping.

                            The scope of variables is defined by their position in the code. In order to resolve
                            variables, JavaScript starts at the
                            innermost scope and searches outwards until it finds the variable it was looking for. In the
                            above example, Javascript
                            first searches for variables inside innerFunction() and when it doesn’t find it, it goes
                            outside i.e outerFunction()

                            Lexical scoping is better because we can easily figure out the value of a variable from the
                            code, whereas in dynamic
                            scoping, the meaning of a variable can change at runtime, which makes it complex to
                            understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, we have successfully understood what lexical scoping is, now let’s look at closures
                            where lexical scoping is
                            actually used.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Closures</strong>
                        <p>
                            According to the Mozilla Development Network(MDN) :

                            “A closure is a special kind of object that combines two things: a function, and the
                            environment in which that function
                            was created. The environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time
                            that the closure was
                            created.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, let's look at a simple example to start:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                var outerFunction = function () {
                                    let variable1 = "Example of closure"
                                    
                                    var innerFunction = function () {
                                        console.log(variable1)
                                    }
                                    return innerFunction;
                                }
                                
                                var newFunction = outerFunction()
                                newFunction()
                                //Example of closure
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The main point to think here is outerFunction() returns innerFunction() , so the
                            newFunction() is in fact
                            innerFunction(), but we didn’t return variable1. Still, it is a part of newFunction(), so
                            where does the value of
                            variable1 comes from if outerFunction() is already returned i.e. finished executing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This accessing of a variable outside the immediate scope will give rise to a closure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since variable1 was part of the lexical environment that created innerFunction(),
                            innerFunction() will have access to
                            it.
                            <br>
                            Let's look at another example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function add(x) {
                                    return function(y) {
                                        return x + y;
                                    };
                                }
                                
                                var addFive = add(5);
                                var addTen = add(10);
                                
                                console.log(addFive(10)); // 15
                                console.log(addTen(10)); // 20
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Just FYI, this is a widely used example for closure and you may find it many tutorials, here
                            we have defined the
                            function add() with a parameter x which returns another function with parameter y, which
                            returns the sum of x and y.
                            <br>
                            Now we create new functions addFive() and addTen(), by passing arguments inside add()
                            function, these addTen() and
                            addFive() are actually closures, and although they have the same function body definition,
                            they store different lexical
                            environments. In addFive() lexical environment, x is five, while in the lexical environment
                            for addTen(), x is ten.
                            <br>
                            Closures are a very important part of programming, not only in JavaScript but in all
                            programming languages. They have so
                            many practical applications like object data privacy, event handlers and callback functions,
                            and other functional
                            programming patterns.

                            I hope by now you have a basic understanding of scope in JavaScript, we have covered a brief
                            introduction to lexical
                            scoping and closures in this post.
