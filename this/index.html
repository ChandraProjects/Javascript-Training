                        <strong>Object methods,"this"</strong>
                        <p>Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and
                            so on:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let user = {
                                    name: "John",
                                    age: 30
                                };
                                user.sayHi = function() {
                                    alert("Hello!");
                                };
                                
                                user.sayHi(); // Hello!
                            </pre>
                            <p>Here we’ve just used a Function Expression to create the function and assign it to the
                                property user.sayHi of the
                                object.

                                Then we can call it. The user can now speak!

                                A function that is the property of an object is called its method.

                                So, here we’ve got a method sayHi of the object user.

                                Of course, we could use a pre-declared function as a method, like this:</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let user = {
                                    // ...
                                };

                                // first, declare
                                function sayHi() {
                                    alert("Hello!");
                                };

                                // then add as a method
                                user.sayHi = sayHi;

                                user.sayHi(); // Hello!
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // these objects do the same
                                
                                user = {
                                    sayHi: function() {
                                        alert("Hello");
                                    }
                                };
                                
                                // method shorthand looks better, right?
                                user = {
                                    sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function()"
                                        alert("Hello");
                                    }
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <strong>"this” in methods</strong>
                        <p>It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do
                            its job.
                        </p>
                        <p>For instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.
                            <br>
                            To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.
                            <br>
                            The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let user = {
                                    name: "John",
                                    age: 30,
                                    
                                    sayHi() {
                                    // "this" is the "current object"
                                        alert(this.name);
                                    }
                                };

                            </pre>
                            <p>Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Technically, it’s also possible to access the object without this, by referencing it via the
                            outer variable:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let user = {
                                    name: "John",
                                    age: 30,
                                    
                                    sayHi() {
                                        alert(user.name); // "user" instead of "this"
                                    }
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            …But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy user to another variable, e.g. admin =
                            user and overwrite user with
                            something else, then it will access the wrong object.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>

                                    }
                                };
                                
                                
                                let admin = user;
                                user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious
                                
                                admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
                            </pre>
                            <p>If we used this.name instead of user.name inside the alert, then the code would work.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>For instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different
                            “this” in the calls:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">

                                let admin = { name: "Admin" };

                                // use the same function in two objects
                                user.f = sayHi;
                                admin.f = sayHi;
                                
                                // these calls have different this
                                // "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
                                user.f(); // John (this == user)
                                admin.f(); // Admin (this == admin)
                                
                                admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
                            </pre>
                            <p>The rule is simple: if obj.f() is called, then this is obj during the call of f. So it’s
                                either user or admin in the
                                example above.</p>
                        </div>
                        <strong>Arrow functions have no “this”</strong>
                        <p>Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such
                            a function, it’s taken
                            from the outer “normal” function.</p>
                        <p>For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let user = {
                                    firstName: "Ilya",
                                    sayHi() {
                                    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
                                        arrow();
                                    }
                                };
                                
                                user.sayHi(); // Ilya
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            That’s a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to
                            have a separate this, but
                            rather to take it from the outer context.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Recap</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
                            </li>
                            <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
                            </li>
                            <li>Methods can reference the object as this.
                            </li>
                            <li>The value of this is defined at run-time.
                            </li>
                            <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the
                                function is called.
                            </li>
                            <li>A function can be copied between objects.
                            </li>
                            <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this
                                during the call is object.
                            </li>
                            <li>Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed
                                inside an arrow function, it is
                                taken from outside.
                            </li>
