                        <strong>Javascript Inheritance
                        </strong>
                        <p>In JavaScript, we can create classes where the properties can be included in the properties
                            of a child class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, we can have a high-level class that contains the properties that are common to all the
                            child classes, and the child
                            class can have its own special properties that are not in any other classes.</p>

                        <p>For example, if we have an Animal class with the common properties and methods, like name
                            and the eat method, then the
                            Bird class can just inherit the common properties in the Animal class. They don’t have to be
                            defined in the Bird class
                            again.
                        </p>
                        <p>We can write the following to do inheritance in JavaScript:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                class Animal {
                                    constructor(name) {
                                        this.name = name;
                                    }
                                    eat() {
                                        console.log('eat');
                                    }
                                }

                                class Bird extends Animal {
                                    constructor(name, numWings) {
                                        super(name);
                                        this.numWings = numWings;
                                    }
                                }

                                const bird = new Bird('Joe', 2);
                                console.log(bird.name)
                                bird.eat();
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the example above, we have the parent class, Animal, that has the eat method, which all
                            classes that extends from
                            Animal will have, so they don’t have to define eat again.</p>

                        <p>
                            We have the Bird class which extends the Animal class. Note that in the constructor of the
                            Bird class, we have the
                            super() function call to call the parent’s class constructor to populate the properties of
                            the parent class in addition
                            to the properties of the child class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Classes cannot extend regular objects, which cannot be constructed with the new keyword. If
                            we want to inherit from a
                            regular object, we have to use the Object.setPrototypeOf function to set a class to inherit
                            from a regular object. For
                            example:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                const Animal = {
                                    eat() {
                                        console.log(`${this.name} eats`);
                                    }
                                };

                                class Cat{
                                    constructor(name) {
                                        this.name = name;
                                    }
                                }

                                class Chicken{
                                    constructor(name) {
                                        this.name = name;
                                    }
                                }

                                Object.setPrototypeOf(Cat.prototype, Animal);
                                Object.setPrototypeOf(Chicken.prototype, Animal);

                                let cat = new Cat('Bob');
                                let chicken = new Chicken('Joe');
                                cat.eat();
                                chicken.eat();
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>If we run the example code above, we can see Bob eats and Joe eats logged because we have
                            inherited the eat function
                            from the Animal object.</p>

                        <strong>'this' Keyword
                        </strong>

                        <p>
                            The this keyword allows us to access the current object’s properties inside the object,
                            unless you’re using arrow
                            functions.
                            <br>
                            As we can see from the above example, we can get the properties of the instance of the child
                            and the parent class in the
                            object.
                        </p>
