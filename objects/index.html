                        <strong>What is an object?</strong>
                        <p>
                            An object in JavaScript is quite similar to an array — it is a data type which stores lots
                            of values. These values can
                            be any data type — numbers, strings, booleans, functions, and even arrays and objects!

                            The difference between an array and an object is how the values are referenced. In an array,
                            you reference a value with
                            a number (its position in the array) — for example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>myArray[3]</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>When referencing a value in an object, you do so using a name instead of a number. For
                            example:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>myObject['name']</pre>
                            <p>That's it! Name instead of number.</p>
                        </div>
                        <strong>How to declare an object
                        </strong>
                        <p>The syntax for declaring an object is different to the syntax for an array. Here's what it
                            looks like:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                var myFriend = {
                                    firstName: 'John', 
                                    lastName: 'Smith', 
                                    age: 27, 
                                    nationality: 'British'
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>As you can see, it's kind of similar to the array syntax, but it has curly brackets instead
                            of square brackets. The
                            items are still comma-separated. However, the items now have a 'name' as well as a value.
                            For example:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>age: 27</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Here, age is the name (aka 'key') of the item and 27 is the item's value. They are separated
                            by a colon.</p>
                        <p>We call this a key-value pair. It has a key and a value... (really?)</p>
                        <p>
                            So an object is made of key-value pairs separated by commas, and the whole thing is wrapped
                            in a set of curly brackets.
                        </p>
                        <strong>How to get/set a value in an object
                        </strong>
                        <p>As I mentioned near the beginning, this is how you reference an item in an object:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>myObject['key']</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>You can express it this way as well:(myObject.key)</p>
                        <p>With the second option, you can't have variables or special characters (including spaces) as
                            the key. For example, these
                            wouldn't work:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                myObject[someVarContainingTheKey];
                                myObject['I have spaces and special characters ;)']
                                // As you can see, they don't turn out so well!

                                myObject.someVarContainingTheKey // No longer a variable - equivalent to myObject['someVarContainingTheKey']
                                myObject.I have spaces and special characters ;) // \0_0/ The syntax errors are killing me
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>It's worth saying that it is bad programming practice to use special characters in variable
                            names or object keys. The
                            exception would be if you were using a form of user input (which might include spaces) as
                            your key.</p>
                        <p>
                            Unless you have special characters or a variable as your key, it is best to use the second
                            option (myObject.key). Why?
                            It just looks nicer (it also makes more sense for functions, which you'll see soon). But
                            it's up to you.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Functions in objects
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            I told you at the start that objects can have any types of data inside them. This includes
                            functions! But how would you
                            actually put one inside an object?

                            Let's use our friend example from earlier and we had a function:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                var myFriend = {
                                    firstName: 'John',
                                    lastName: 'Smith',
                                    age: 27,
                                    nationality: 'British',
                                    sayHi: function() {
                                      alert('Hi!');
                                    }
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>And we add function to our object. This means that we could call it like so:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>myFriend.sayHi()</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Look familiar? This is why console.log() is console.log()! console is an object with a log
                            function inside of it!</p>
