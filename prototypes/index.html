                        <strong>Problem with constructor</strong>
                        <p>We will discuss what are prototypes in JavaScript, how they help JavaScript in achieving the
                            concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Problem with creating objects with the constructor function:
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            Consider the constructor function below:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                            function Human(firstName, lastName) {
                                this.firstName = firstName,
                                this.lastName = lastName,
                                this.fullName = function() {
                                    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
                                }
                            }

                            var person1 = new Human("MS", "Dhoni");

                            console.log(person1)
                        </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Let’s create objects person1 and person2 using the Human constructor function:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                            var person2 = new Human("Sachin", "Tendulkar");
                            var person1 = new Human("MS", "Dhoni");
                        </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>On executing the above code, the JavaScript engine will create two copies of the constructor
                            function, each for person1 and person2.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/constructorfunction.png" alt="Constructor function">
                        <p>
                            i.e. every object created using the constructor function will have its own copy of
                            properties and methods. It doesn’t
                            make sense to have two instances of function fullName that do the same thing. Storing
                            separate instances of function for
                            each object results in wastage of memory. We will see as we move forward, how we can solve
                            this issue.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Prototypes</strong>
                        <p>
                            When a function is created in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property to
                            the function. This
                            prototype property is an object (called a prototype object) that has a constructor property
                            by default. The constructor
                            property points back to the function on which prototype object is a property. We can access
                            the function’s prototype
                            property using functionName.prototype.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../assets//prototypeObj.png" alt="prototype object">
                        <p>
                            As shown in the above image, Human constructor function has a prototype property that points
                            to the prototype object.
                            The prototype object has a constructor property that points back to the Human constructor
                            function.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let’s see an example below:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function Human(firstName, lastName) {
                                    this.firstName = firstName,
                                    this.lastName = lastName,
                                    this.fullName = function() {
                                        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
                                    }
                                }
                                
                                var person1 = new Human("Virat", "Kohli");
                                
                                console.log(person1)
                            </pre>

                        <p>
                            To access the prototype property of the Human constructor function, use the below syntax:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                console.log(Human.prototype);
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            As seen from the above image prototype property of the function is an object (prototype
                            object) with two properties:

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>constructor property which points to Human function itself</li>
                            <li>__proto__ property: We will discuss this while explaining inheritance in JavaScript</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>Creating an object using the constructor function
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            When an object is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a __proto__ property to the
                            newly created object which
                            is called dunder proto. dunder proto or __proto__ points to the prototype object of the
                            constructor function.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As shown in the above image, the person1 object which is created using the Human constructor
                            function has a dunder proto
                            or __proto__ property which points to the prototype object of the constructor function.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">

                            As can be seen from the above image, both person1’s dunder proto or __proto__ property and
                            Human.prototype property is
                            equal. Let’s check if they point at the same location using === operator

                            Now, let’s create another object person2 using the Human constructor function</p>
                        <div class="code_block">

                        <p>
                            Above console output shows that even person2’s dunder proto property is equal to the
                            Human.prototype property and they
                            point to the same object.

                            As a prototype object is an object, we can attach properties and methods to the prototype
                            object. Thus, enabling all the
                            objects created using the constructor function to share those properties and methods.
                            The new property can be added to the constructor function’s prototype property using either
                            the dot notation or square
                            bracket notation as shown below:

                            When we try to access a property of an object, the JavaScript engine first tries to find the
                            property on the object, if
                            the property is present on the object it outputs its value. But, if the property is not
                            present on the object then it
                            tries to find the property on the prototype object or dunder proto of the object. If the
                            property is found the value is
                            returned else JavaScript engine tries to find the property on the dunder proto of the
                            object. This chain continues until
                            the dunder proto property is null. In these cases, the output will be undefined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, when person1.name is called, JavaScript engine checks if the property exists on the
                            person1 object. In this case,
                            name property was not on the person1’s object. So, now JavaScript engine checks if the name
                            property exists on the
                            dunder proto property or the prototype of the person1’s object. In this case, name property
                            was there on the dunder
                            proto property or the prototype of person1’s object. Hence, the output was returned Ashwin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let’s create another object person2 using the Person constructor function.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                var person2 = new Person();
                                //Access the name property using the person2 object
                                console.log(person2.name)// Output: Ashwin
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Now, let’s define a property name on the person1 object
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                person1.name = "Anil"
                                console.log(person1.name)//Output: Anil
                                console.log(person2.name)//Output: Ashwin
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Here person1.name outputs “Anil”. As mentioned earlier, the JavaScript engine first tries to
                            find the property on the
                            object itself. In this case, name property is present on the object person1 itself, hence
                            JavaScript engines outputs the
                            value of name property of person1.
                            In the case of person2, the name property is not present on the object. Hence, it outputs
                            person2’s prototype object’s
                            property name.

                            Problems with the prototype

                        <p>
                            As prototype object is shared among all the objects created using the constructor function,
                            its properties and methods
                            are also shared among all the objects. If an object A modifies a property of the prototype
                            having primitive value, other
                            objects will not get affected by, as object A will create a property on its objects as shown
                            below.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">

                                console.log(perosn1.name);//Output: Ganguly
                                console.log(person2.name);//Output: Ashwin

                        <p>
                            form the above code (line 1 and 2), both person1 and person2 does not have name property,
                            hence
                            they access
                            the prototypes name
                            property and hence the output is same for both.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When person1 want to have a different value for the name property, it creates a name
                            property on its object.

                            In the above example, person1 and person2 point to the same friends' array of the prototype

                            friends property by adding another string in the array.<br>
                            As friends' array exists on Person.prototype, not on person1, the changes made in the

                            object is reflected on person2.friends also (which points to the same array).<br>
                            If the intention is to have an array shared by all instances, then this outcome is okay. But

                            To solve the problems with the prototype and the problems with the constructor, we can
                            combine both the constructor and
                            function.

                                Problem with the prototype: Modifying a property using one object reflects the other

                            To solve both problems, we can define all the object-specific properties inside the
                            constructor and all shared
                            properties and methods inside the prototype as shown below:

                            Here as we have wanted each object to have their own name, age, and friends property. Hence,
                            we have defined these
                            properties inside the constructor using this. However, as sayName is defined on the
                            prototype object, it will be shared
                            among all the objects.<br>
                            In the above example, the friend’s property of person2 did not change on changing the
