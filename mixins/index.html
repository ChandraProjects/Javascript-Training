                        <strong>Mixins?</strong>
                        <p>We can use mixins to do multiple inheritance in JavaScript. Mixins are templates for creating
                            classes. We need mixins to
                            do multiple inheritance because JavaScript classes can only inherit from one super class, so
                            multiple inheritance isn’t
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if we have a base class, we can define mixins to incorporate the members from
                            multiple classes into one by
                            composing the mixins by calling one and then pass the returned result into the next one as
                            the argument, and so on, like
                            the following:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                class Base {
                                    baseFn() {
                                        console.log('baseFn called');
                                    }
                                }

                                let classAMixin = Base => class extends Base {
                                    a() {
                                        console.log('classAMixin called');
                                    }
                                };

                                let classBMixin = Base => class extends Base {
                                    b() {
                                        console.log('classBMixin called');
                                    }
                                };

                                class Bar extends classAMixin(classBMixin(Base)) {};

                                const bar = new Bar();
                                
                                bar.baseFn() // baseFn called
                                bar.a() // classAMixin called
                                bar.b() // classBMixin called
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In the code above, we have the Base class which we pass into the classBMixin to get the b
                            function into the Base class,
                            then we call the classAMixin by passing in the result of classBMixin(Base) into the argument
                            of the classAMixin to
                            return the a function from classAMixin into the Base class and then return the whole class
                            with all the functions from
                            all the classes incorporated into one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that we have all the functions from the mixins incorporated into the new Bar
                            class.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In JavaScript, classes are just syntactic sugar to make the prototypical inheritance of
                            JavaScript clearer by letting us
                            structure the code in a way that’s more like typical inheritance in class-based object
                            oriented inheritance pattern.
                            This means that we write classes to use the new keyword to create objects from the classes,
                            but underneath the syntactic
                            sugar, we are still using prototypical inheritance to extend objects. We can extend classes
                            from objects and we can also
                            use mixins to do multiple inheritance in JavaScript classes.
