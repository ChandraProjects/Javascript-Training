                        <strong>Maps</strong>
                        <p>
                            A Map is a collection of key/value pairs that can use any data type as a key and can
                            maintain the order of its entries.
                            Maps have elements of both Objects (a unique key/value pair collection) and Arrays (an
                            ordered collection), but are more
                            similar to Objects conceptually. This is because, although the size and order of entries is
                            preserved like an Array, the
                            entries themselves are key/value pairs like Objects.
                            <br>
                            Maps can be initialized with the new Map() syntax:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>const map = new Map();</code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>This gives us an empty Map: Map(0) {}</p>
                        </div>
                        <strong>Adding Values to a Map</strong>
                        <p>
                            You can add values to a map with the set() method. The first argument will be the key, and
                            the second argument will be
                            the value.
                            <br>
                            The following adds three key/value pairs to map:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>map.set('firstName', 'Luke')</code>
                                <code>map.set('lastName', 'Skywalker')</code>
                                <code>map.set('occupation', 'Jedi Knight')</code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Here we begin to see how Maps have elements of both Objects and Arrays. Like an Array, we
                            have a zero-indexed
                            collection, and we can also see how many items are in the Map by default. Maps use the =>
                            syntax to signify key/value
                            pairs as key => value:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>Map(3)</code>
                                <code>0: {"firstName" => "Luke"}</code>
                                <code>1: {"lastName" => "Skywalker"}</code>
                                <code>2: {"occupation" => "Jedi Knight"}</code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                This example looks similar to a regular object with string-based keys, but we can use
                                any data type as a key with Map.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In addition to manually setting values on a Map, we can also initialize a Map with values
                            already. We can do this using an Array of Arrays containing two elements that are each
                            key/value pairs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using the following syntax, we can recreate the same Map:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>const map = new Map([</code>
                                    <code>&nbsp;['firstName', 'Luke'],</code>
                                    <code>&nbsp;['lastName', 'Skywalker'],</code>
                                    <code>&nbsp;['occupation', 'Jedi Knight'],</code>
                                <code>])</code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                Incidentally, this syntax is the same as the result of calling Object.entries() on an
                                Object. This provides a ready-made
                                way to convert an Object to a Map, as shown in the following code block:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                const luke = {
                                    firstName: 'Luke',
                                    lastName: 'Skywalker',
                                    occupation: 'Jedi Knight',
                                }
                                
                                const map = new Map(Object.entries(luke))
                            </pre>
                            <p>Alternatively, you can turn a Map back into an Object or an Array with a single line of
                                code.
                                <br>
                                The following converts a Map to an Object:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                const obj = Object.fromEntries(map);
                            </pre>
                            <p>This will result in the following value of obj:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // {firstName: "Luke", lastName: "Skywalker", occupation: "Jedi Knight"}
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> Maps accept any data type as a key, and do not allow duplicate key values.</p>
                        <p>
                            Although it is a common belief that a regular JavaScript Object can already handle Numbers,
                            booleans, and other
                            primitive data types as keys, this is actually not the case, because Objects change all keys
                            to strings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an example, initialize an object with a numerical key and compare the value for a
                            numerical 1 key and a stringified
                            "1" key:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // Initialize an object with a numerical key
                                const obj = { 1: 'One' }
                                
                                // The key is actually a string
                                obj[1] === obj['1'] // true
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                This is why if you attempt to use an Object as a key, it will print out the string
                                object Object instead.</p>
                            <p>
                                This is not the case with Map. Try creating an Object and setting it as the key of a
                                Map:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // Create an object
                                const objAsKey = { foo: 'bar' }

                                // Set this object as the key of a Map
                                map.set(objAsKey, 'What will happen?')

                                //Output.............
                                key: {foo: "bar"}
                                value: "What will happen?"
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                The key of the Map element is now the object we created.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p><b>There is one important thing to note about using an Object or Array as a key: the Map is
                                using the reference to the
                                Object to compare equality, not the literal value of the Object. In JavaScript {} === {}
                                returns false, because the two
                                Objects are not the same two Objects, despite having the same (empty) value.

                            But using the same Object reference twice will create a Map with one entry.

                        <div class="code_block">

                                that only has one value.

                        <strong>
                            Getting and Deleting Items from a Map
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            One of the disadvantages of working with Objects is that it can be difficult to enumerate
                            them, or work with all the
                            keys or values. The Map structure, by contrast, has a lot of built-in properties that make
                            working with their elements
                            more direct.

                            We can initialize a new Map to demonstrate the following methods and properties: delete(),
                            has(), get(), and size.
                        </p>

                                const map = new Map([
                                    ['animal', 'otter'],

                            One particular benefit Maps have over Objects is that you can find the size of the Map at
                            any time, like you can with an
                            Array. You can get the count of items in a Map with the size property. This involves fewer
                            steps than converting an
                            Object to an Array to find the length.

                            Use the delete() method to remove an item from a Map by key. The method will return a
                            Boolean—true if an item existed
                            and was deleted, and false if it did not match any item.

                        <strong>Keys, Values, and Entries for Maps</strong>
                        <p>
                            Objects can retrieve keys, values, and entries by using the properties of the Object
                            constructor. Maps, on the other
                            hand, have prototype methods that allow us to get the keys, values, and entries of the Map
                            instance directly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The keys(), values(), and entries() methods all return a MapIterator, which is similar to an
                            Array in that you can use
                            for...of to loop through the values.<br>
                            Here is another example of a Map, which we can use to demonstrate these methods.
                        </p>

                                const map = new Map([
                                    [1970, 'bell bottoms'],
                                    [1980, 'leg warmers'],

                                // The keys() method returns the keys:
                                map.keys(); // MapIterator {1970, 1980, 1990}

                                //The values() method returns the values:
                                map.values() // MapIterator {"bell bottoms", "leg warmers", "flannel"}

                                //The entries() method returns an array of key/value pairs:
                                map.entries() // MapIterator {1970 => "bell bottoms", 1980 => "leg warmers", 1990 => "flannel"}

                            Map has a built-in forEach method, similar to an Array, for built-in iteration. However,
                            there is a bit of a difference
                            in what they iterate over. The callback of a Map's forEach iterates through the value, key,
                            and map itself, while the
                            Array version iterates through the item, index, and array itself.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // Map
                                Map.prototype.forEach((value, key, map) = () => {}
                                
                                // Array
                                Array.prototype.forEach((item, index, array) = () => {}
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This is a big advantage for Maps over Objects, as Objects need to be converted with keys(),
                            values(), or entries(), and
                            there is not an simple way to retrieve the properties of an Object without converting it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To demonstrate this, let's iterate through our Map and log the key/value pairs to the
                            console:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // Log the keys and values of the Map with forEach
                                map.forEach((value, key) => {
                                    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`)
                                })

                                //Output........
                                1970: bell bottoms
                                1980: leg warmers
                                1990: flannel

                            Since a for...of loop iterates over iterables like Map and Array, we can get the exact same
                            result by destructuring the
                            array of Map items.

                        <strong>When to Use Map</strong>
                        <p>
                            Summing up, Maps are similar to Objects in that they hold key/value pairs, but Maps have
                            several advantages over
                            objects:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Size:</b>Maps have a size property, whereas Objects do not have a built-in way to
                                retrieve their size.</li>
                            <li><b>Iteration:</b>Maps are directly iterable, whereas Objects are not.</li>
                            <li><b>Flexibility:</b>Maps can have any data type (primitive or Object) as the key to a
                                value, while Objects can only have strings.</li>
                            <li><b>Ordered:</b>Maps retain their insertion order, whereas objects do not have a
                                guaranteed order.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Due to these factors, Maps are a powerful data structure to consider. However, Objects haves
                            some important advantages
                            as well</p>
