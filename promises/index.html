                        <strong>Promises?</strong>
                        <p>
                            Basically, Promises were made to create better asynchronous callback functions in
                            Javascript, to make the code better
                            organized. To grasp the concept think like it literally means that we are making a promise
                            in real life. For example:
                        </p>
                        <li>I promise that I will make you understand Promises in 15 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <p>For that promise, I can do two things:
                        </p>
                        <li>I can either succeed by making you understand Promises in 15 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Or I can fail and you'll not understand Promises in 15 minutes.</li>
                        <p>In code, it's the very same thing. Ok, so let's see this.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../assets/promise.png">

                        <p>The output for this script is: This is in then: success
                        </p>

                        <p>Here, we have a block inside of a Promise function that sums 1 + 1. If the result is 2, it
                            means that our promise
                            succeded, otherwise, means that our promise was rejected, because 1 + 1 = 2. If we change
                            the number of the sum, we'll
                            be rejected because we're saying that the variable of the sum is 2. If it isn't, promise
                            rejected.</p>

                        <img src="../assets/promisefailed.png">
                        <p>The output for this script is: This is in catch: failed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let's analyze this code
                        </p>

                        <img src="../assets/promise2.png">
                        <p>This code sees if you're using Angular or Vue, if one of those is true, it calls a callback
                            function which sends an
                            alert with a title and a message.
                            <br> Output form above example: angular, eww
                        </p>

                        <p>Now let's change this to a Promise and make this code better.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            First, we create a function that instantiates a Promise, passing our parameters resolve and
                            reject. Then, we write the
                            code that we want to be in that Promise, in my case, I want to ensure that developers are
                            using
                            the React lib. So I make
                            the validation and dispatch the action that I want to execute when the promise resolves and
                            when
                            the promise rejects.
                            Like this:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../assets/promiseex.png">

                        <p>
                            After that, I write the then function calling my Promise and I can do whatever I want in
                            that block. When that Promise
                            is completed, I want to log a message in my console both when I have a resolution or
                            rejection. In the THEN block is the
                            code that runs when my promise is Resolved, and in the CATCH block, the one which runs when
                            my promise is rejected.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../assets/promiseThenExample.png">

                        <p>Also, we can make simultaneous Promises using Promise.ALL when we need to make two or more
                            Promises at the same time.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../assets/promiseAll.png">
                        <p>The output is going to be: Success! Im the first request , Im the second request
                        </p>

                        <p>Or use Promise.RACE if we need to get the result of the first Promise that executes and
                            ignore the upcoming promises.
                        </p>

                        <p>The output is going to be: Success! Im the first request</p>
