                        <p>As we already know, a function in JavaScript is a value.

                            Every value in JavaScript has a type. What type is a function?

                            In JavaScript, functions are objects.

                            A good way to imagine functions is as callable “action objects”. We can not only call them,
                            but also treat them as
                            objects: add/remove properties, pass by reference etc.</p>
                        <strong>The “name” property</strong>
                        <p>
                            Function objects contain some useable properties.

                            For instance, a function’s name is accessible as the “name” property:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function sayHi() {
                                    alert("Hi");
                                }
                                
                                alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>What’s kind of funny, the name-assigning logic is smart. It also assigns the correct name to
                            a function even if it’s
                            created without one, and then immediately assigned:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function() {
                                    alert("Hi");
                                };
                                
                                alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi (there's a name!)

                                //It also works if the assignment is done via a default value:
                                
                                function f(sayHi = function() {}) {
                                    alert(sayHi.name); // sayHi (works!)
                                }

                                f();
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In the specification, this feature is called a “contextual name”. If the function does not
                            provide one, then in an
                            assignment it is figured out from the context.

                            Object methods have names too:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let user = {
                                
                                    sayHi() {
                                        // ...
                                    },
                                
                                    sayBye: function() {
                                        // ...
                                    }
                                
                                }
                                
                                alert(user.sayHi.name); // sayHi
                                alert(user.sayBye.name); // sayBye
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            There’s no magic though. There are cases when there’s no way to figure out the right name.
                            In that case, the name
                            property is empty, like here:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                // function created inside array
                                let arr = [function() {}];
                                
                                alert( arr[0].name ); // <empty string>
                                    // the engine has no way to set up the right name, so there is none
                            </pre>
                            <p>In practice, however, most functions do have a name.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <strong>The “length” property</strong>
                        <p>There is another built-in property “length” that returns the number of function parameters,
                            for instance:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                function f1(a) {}
                                function f2(a, b) {}
                                function many(a, b, ...more) {}
                                
                                alert(f1.length); // 1
                                alert(f2.length); // 2
                                alert(many.length); // 2
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Here we can see that rest parameters are not counted.

                            The length property is sometimes used for introspection in functions that operate on other
                            functions.
                            <br>
                            For instance, in the code below the ask function accepts a question to ask and an arbitrary
                            number of handler functions
                            to call.
                            <br>
                            Once a user provides their answer, the function calls the handlers. We can pass two kinds of
                            handlers:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A zero-argument function, which is only called when the user gives a positive answer.
                            </li>
                            <li>A function with arguments, which is called in either case and returns an answer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <strong>Named Function Expression</strong>
                        <p>Named Function Expression, or NFE, is a term for Function Expressions that have a name.

                            For instance, let’s take an ordinary Function Expression:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function(who) {
                                    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                };  

                                //And add a name to it:
                                let sayHi = function func(who) {
                                    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Did we achieve anything here? What’s the purpose of that additional "func" name?

                            First let’s note, that we still have a Function Expression. Adding the name "func" after
                            function did not make it a
                            Function Declaration, because it is still created as a part of an assignment expression.

                            Adding such a name also did not break anything.

                            The function is still available as sayHi():
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function func(who) {
                                    alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                };
                                
                                sayHi("John"); // Hello, John
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            There are two special things about the name func, that are the reasons for it:

                            * It allows the function to reference itself internally.
                            * It is not visible outside of the function.
                            <br>
                            For instance, the function sayHi below calls itself again with "Guest" if no who is
                            provided:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function func(who) {
                                    if (who) {
                                        alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                    } else {
                                    func("Guest"); // use func to re-call itself
                                    }
                                };

                                sayHi(); // Hello, Guest

                                // But this won't work:
                                func(); // Error, func is not defined (not visible outside of the function)
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Why do we use func? Maybe just use sayHi for the nested call?

                            Actually, in most cases we can:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function(who) {
                                    if (who) {
                                        alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                    } else {
                                        sayHi("Guest");
                                    }
                                };
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The problem with that code is that sayHi may change in the outer code. If the function gets
                            assigned to another variable
                            instead, the code will start to give errors:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function(who) {
                                    if (who) {
                                        alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                    } else {
                                        sayHi("Guest"); // Error: sayHi is not a function
                                    }
                                };
                                
                                let welcome = sayHi;
                                sayHi = null;
                                
                                welcome(); // Error, the nested sayHi call doesn't work any more!
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            That happens because the function takes sayHi from its outer lexical environment. There’s no
                            local sayHi, so the outer
                            variable is used. And at the moment of the call that outer sayHi is null.

                            The optional name which we can put into the Function Expression is meant to solve exactly
                            these kinds of problems.
                            <br>
                            Let’s use it to fix our code:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let sayHi = function func(who) {
                                    if (who) {
                                        alert(`Hello, ${who}`);
                                    } else {
                                        func("Guest"); // Now all fine
                                    }
                                };
                                
                                let welcome = sayHi;
                                sayHi = null;
                                
                                welcome(); // Hello, Guest (nested call works)
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now it works, because the name "func" is function-local. It is not taken from outside (and
                            not visible there). The
                            specification guarantees that it will always reference the current function.

                            The outer code still has it’s variable sayHi or welcome. And func is an “internal function
                            name”, how the function can
                            call itself internally.</p>
                        <strong>Recap</strong>
                        <p>
                            Functions are objects.
                            <br>
                            Here we covered their properties:
                            <br>
                            * name – the function name. Usually taken from the function definition, but if there’s none,
                            JavaScript tries to guess it
                            from the context (e.g. an assignment).
                            <br>
                            * length – the number of arguments in the function definition. Rest parameters are not
                            counted.
                            <br>
                            If the function is declared as a Function Expression (not in the main code flow), and it
                            carries the name, then it is
                            called a Named Function Expression. The name can be used inside to reference itself, for
                            recursive calls or such.
                            <br>
                            Also, functions may carry additional properties. Many well-known JavaScript libraries make
                            great use of this feature.
                            <br>
                            They create a “main” function and attach many other “helper” functions to it. For instance,
                            the jQuery library creates a
                            function named $. The lodash library creates a function _, and then adds _.clone, _.keyBy
                            and other properties to it
                            (see the docs when you want learn more about them). Actually, they do it to lessen their
                            pollution of the global space,
                            so that a single library gives only one global variable. That reduces the possibility of
                            naming conflicts.
                            <br>
                            So, a function can do a useful job by itself and also carry a bunch of other functionality
                            in properties.
