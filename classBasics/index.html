                        <p>
                            <b>The most important thing to remember:</b> Classes are just normal JavaScript functions
                            and could be completely replicated
                            without using the class syntax. It is special syntactic sugar added in ES6 to make it easier
                            to declare and inherit
                            complex objects.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Defining Classes</strong>
                        <p>To declare a class, we use the class keyword. For example, to declare a simple class, we can
                            write:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                class Person{
                                    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                                    this.firstName= firstName;
                                        this.lastName = lastName;
                                    }
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>Class declarations aren’t hoisted so they can’t be used before they are defined in the code,
                            as the JavaScript
                            interpreter will not automatically pull them up to the top. So the class above won’t work
                            before it’s defined in the
                            code like the following:</p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                const person = new Person('John', 'Smith');
                                
                                class Person{
                                    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                                        this.firstName = firstName;
                                        this.lastName = lastName;
                                    }
                                }

                                //We will get a ReferenceError if we run this code above.
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            We can also define a class by a class expression, which is an alternative syntax. They can
                            be named or unnamed. We can
                            also assign a class to a variable like we do with functions. If we do that, we can reference
                            the class by its name. For
                            example, we can define:
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let Person = class {
                                    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                                        this.firstName = firstName;
                                        this.lastName = lastName;
                                    }
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>To get the name of the unnamed classes above, we can get the name with the name property,
                            like so:</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                console.log(Person.name);
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>We can also define a named class like the following:</p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                let Person = class Person2 {
                                    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                                        this.firstName = firstName;
                                        this.lastName = lastName;
                                    }
                                }

                                // Then to get the name of the class, we can use the name property again. So we if we write:
                                console.log(Person.name);
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>We get Person2 logged.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The class body is defined with curly brackets. We define the class members inside the
                            brackets. The body of the class is
                            executed in strict mode, so everything defined in strict mode applies to the definition of a
                            class, so we can’t define
                            variables without keyword before it like var , let or const, and many other rules apply when
                            you define a class.
                        </p>

                        <p>Classes in JavaScript also have a constructor method that lets us set fields when the object
                            is instantiated with a
                            class. Each class can only have one constructor method in it. If there’s more than one, then
                            SyntaxError will be thrown.
                            A constructor can also call the super method to call the constructor of the super class if
                            the class extends a parent
                            class.</p>

                        <p>
                            Methods that aren’t declared static constitutes the prototypical methods of the class. They
                            are called after an object
                            has been created by using the new keyword. For example, the following class has only
                            prototypical methods:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                class Person{
                                    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                                        this.firstName = firstName;
                                        this.lastName = lastName;
                                    }

                                    get fullName(){
                                        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
                                    }
                                    sayHi(){
                                        return `Hi, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
                                    }
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>In the Person class above, fullName and sayHi are prototypical methods. They are called like
                            this:</p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                const person = new Person('Jane', 'Smith');
                                person.fullName() // 'Jane Smith'
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Static methods are methods that can be called without creating an object from the class
                            using the new keyword. For
                            instance, we can have something like the following:
                        </p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                class Person {
                                    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
                                        this.firstName = firstName;
                                        this.lastName = lastName;
                                    }
                                    get fullName() {
                                        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
                                    }
                                    sayHi() {
                                        return `Hi, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
                                    }
                                    static personCount() {
                                        return 3;
                                    }
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>We can call the personCount function without using the new keyword to create an instance of
                            the class. So if we write:</p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>Person.personCount // 3</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The this value inside prototypical methods will be the value of the object. For static
                            methods the value of this has the
                            class that the static method is in as the value.
                        </p>
