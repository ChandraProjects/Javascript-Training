                        <strong>What is a Function?</strong>
                        <p>Functions are basically ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù of the program or we can say a function is a
                            process which takes some input
                            called arguments and produces some output called a return value.They allow the code to be
                            called many times without
                            repetition.</p>
                        <p>
                            Functions are key to the programming and we can reuse the functions

                            So let's talk about how functions work in JavaScript.
                            Every function in JavaScript starts with a keyword function.

                            Let's write our first function we already know every function starts
                            with a keyword function.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Function Declaration</strong>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                                <div>
                                function add(a,b){
                                    return a+b;
                                }
                                </div>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>We called it as function defintion or function statements/declaration.<br>
                            Function declarations are hoisted‚Äîmoved in their entirety to the beginning of the current
                            scope.
                        </p>
                        <p>What above function does is a function with a name add takes
                            two parameters and returns the addition of two parameters.</p>
                        <p>So By defining a function cant do any work to make functions work we need to invoke
                            it/calling a function is called
                            function invocation.</p>
                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>add(1,2) //3</pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>we are passing two arguments to the function which are 1,2 so we get an output of 1 and 2
                            which is 3.

                            What the hell arguments/parameters have you confused why I'm calling in different names in
                            the same function.</p>
                        <strong>The Special Variable arguments</strong>
                        <p>You can call any function in JavaScript with an arbitrary amount of arguments; the language
                            will never complain. It
                            will, however, make all parameters available via the special variable arguments. arguments
                            look like an array, but has
                            none of the array methods:</p>

                        <strong>Lets clear confusion now.</strong>
                        <p>
                            <b>Parameters:</b> which are passing to the function at the time of declaration.
                            Parameters are named variables which are a,b in our add function.

                            <b>Arguments:</b> Which are passing to the function at the time of invocation.Arguments are
                            the
                            values which are 1,2 in our add
                            function.

                            What return does to our function is it necessaryüòõ.
                            return is a keyword it helps to stop‚úã the running function.
                        </p>

                        <div class="code_block">
                            <pre>
                            function printNumbers(n){
                                if(n === 1){
                                    return 1;
                                }
                                if(n === 2){
                                    return 2;
                                }
                            }
                        </pre>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            In above example, we are stopping the function if n is 1/n is 2.
                            so we are stooping function at 2 different times.

                            if n is 1 then we never reach the line 3 because we are using return at
                            line 2.so our function stops runningü§ô at line 2 and gives output 1.
